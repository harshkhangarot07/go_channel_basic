// The select statement is used to wait on multiple channel operations. It is like a switch statement but for channels:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		ch1 <- "one"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		ch2 <- "two"
	}() // you can invoke anonymous function immediately after defining it , you add () at the end of the function

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-ch1:
			fmt.Println("Received", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-ch2:
			fmt.Println("Received", msg2)
		}
	}

}
